**Warning:** Sparky is still experimental and under development. The engine should be considered a learning resource for anyone interested in game engine programming. Sparky is not yet ready to create production games. With that in mind, if your goal is to **create a game**, a more mature engine such as **Unity** or **Unreal** will suit your needs.
